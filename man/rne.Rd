\title{ Random, neighbour, environment deletion analysis for transfer function model }
\description{
  Calculates effect of deleting sites from training set at random, from a geographic neighbourhood, or from an environmental neighbourhood. A simple graphical technique for gauging the effect of spatial autocorrelation on the transfer function model.
}
\usage{
rne(y, env, geodist,fun, neighbours, subsets = c(1,0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1), ...) 
\method{plot}{RNE}(x, which=1, ylim, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{Community data, or distance object, or distance matrix}
  \item{env}{Environmental variable}
  \item{geodist}{Matrix of geographical distances between sites}
  \item{fun}{Transfer function}
  \item{neighbours}{ Neighbourhood radii }
  \item{subsets}{ Proportion of sites to retain in random deletion }
  \item{...}{Arguments passed to fun or plot}
  \item{x}{RNE object to be plotted}
  \item{which}{Which column of the results to plot eg if more than one WAPLS component is calculated}
  \item{ylim}{Y-limits of the plot}
  
  
  
}
\details{
  Finds the leave-one-out transfer function performance if sites are deleted at random (repeated 10 times to reduce variance in results), from a neighbourhood zone, or by deleting environmentally close sites.
}
\value{
  Returns an RNE object, list with two components
  
  \item{random }{Performance with random deletion.}
  \item{neighbour }{Performance with deletion by neighourhood, or environment}
